![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/metpy.svg)

covid19GR is a simple R Shiny app to track daily vaccinations against COVID-19 in Greece. The web app scrapes data from Johns Hopkins GitHub repository every day and displays four time series plots in near real-time: a) People vaccinated with 2 doses, b) People vaccinated with 1 dose, c) Daily cases of COVID-19 since vaccinations started and d) Daily deaths due to COVID-19 since vaccinations started.
